# NetCheck API

NetCheck API is an simple network monitoring API. It's designed to be used in combination with a monitoring tool. The Docker container exposes endpoints to ping IP addresses, conduct TCP port scans and check available access points. Secure the exposed port and start checking the status of your (local) network.

## Installation
To run the container, use the following command:
```bash
docker run --privileged -d -e PORT=2025 -e API_KEY=123456789 -e DEVICE=wlan0 --network host --restart=always purplebite/netcheck-api:latest
```
NetCheck API is now running on http://localhost:2025.

- If the API key is not specified during container startup no API key is required.
- If the DEVICE variable is not passed during container startup, the default value is set to wlan0. If you're unsure about the device name, you can use the `ifconfig` command to find the name of the WiFi interface. To install use `sudo apt install net-tools` .

## Usage
When NetCheck API is running it listens for incoming HTTP requests. Four endpoints are available:

1. Ping: To check the reachability of an IP address
2. TCP port scan: To conduct a TCP port scan on a specific port of an IP address
3. Access point verification: To check the availability of access points
4. Speedtest: To measure the available internet speed

### Ping Endpoint

To check the reachability of an IP address, send a GET request to `/ping/<ip_address>` with the API key provided as a query parameter. 

**Example Request:**
```
GET http://localhost:2025/ping/192.168.1.1?api_key=123456789
```

**Example Response (Success):**
```json
{
    "status": "success"
}
```

**Example Response (Error):**
```json
{
    "status": "error"
}
```

### TCP Check Endpoint

To conduct a TCP port scan on a specific port of an IP address, send a GET request to `/tcp-check/<ip_address>/<port>` with the API key provided as a query parameter.

**Example Request:**
```
GET http://localhost:2025/tcp-check/192.168.1.2/80?api_key=123456789
```

**Example Response (Success):**
```json
{
    "status": "success"
}
```

**Example Response (Error):**
```json
{
    "status": "error"
}
```

### Access Points Endpoint

To get a list of access points along with their signal strengths, send a GET request to `/accesspoints` with the API key provided as a query parameter.

**Example Request:**
```
GET http://localhost:2025/accesspoints?api_key=123456789
```

**Example Response (Success):**
```json
{
    "access_points": [
        {
            "SSID": "Home",
            "signal_strength": -22.0
        },
        {
            "SSID": "Guest",
            "signal_strength": -43.0
        }
    ],
    "status": "success"
}
```

**Example Response (Error):**
```json
{
    "status": "error"
}
```
### Speedtest Endpoint

To measure the available internet speed, send a GET request to `/speedtest` with the API key provided as a query parameter.

**Example Request:**
```
GET http://localhost:2025/speedtest?api_key=123456789
```

**Example Response (Success):**
```json
{
  "bytes_received": 31593473,
  "bytes_sent": 21651456,
  "client": {},
  "download": 25134202.9586848,
  "download_mbps": "201",
  "ping": 28.992,
  "server": {},
  "status": "success",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-01T20:00:00.268022Z",
  "upload": 16235909.308740227,
  "upload_mbps": "130"
}
```
**Example Response (Error):**
```json
{
    "status": "error"
}
```

An optional environment parameter for the Speedtest endpoint via docker is: SERVERID. With this parameter you can define which [server](https://www.google.com/search?q=How+to+find+a+Speedtest.net+server+ID) should be used for testing the internet bandwidth. Usage example:
```bash
docker run --privileged -d -e PORT=2025 -e API_KEY=123456789 -e DEVICE=wlan0 -e SERVERID=19035 --network host --restart=always purplebite/netcheck-api:latest
```
## Notes

- NetCheck API is designed for [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/), but works on all Linux machines
- The easiest way to secure the exposed port is via a [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://github.com/anderspitman/awesome-tunneling)
